## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

 Hope life finds you well.  
 I'm Carolina and I currently work full-time as a Full-Stack Wordpress Developer for a Growth Marketing company.  
 My experience as a full-time employee has been mostly in that area (Marketing).   
 As a freelancer I've worked with many sectors, ONGs, Logistics, Custody, Banking, E-commerce, Hubspot, Salesforce,  Finance, Design Agencies and software development. 

 - I've been working in web development for the last 10 years. 
 - I'm a wordpress and PHP fan.
 - I am detail-oriented and I like to stay organized or die trying. 
 - I'm google analytics certified and I have worked with the GA API in plenty of projects. 
 - I'm also looking to start new experiences with WP REACT and Gutemberg Blocks. 
 - I love listening to symphonic and power metal, but my entire spotify can be ecleptic and go from Eminen to Avantasia.
 - I love camping/hiking/trekking, playing videogames, drawing and painting and travelling with my notebook under my arm. 
 - I speak fluent English and Spanish, and really basic Russian.
